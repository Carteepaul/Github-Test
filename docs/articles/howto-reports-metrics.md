# Reports and metrics management

This article provides information about the reports and metrics functions of Project Amber. Reports and metrics can provide a summary of the attestation tokens and API key usage for your subscription along with the status and response times. Project Amber supports pre-defined and custom reports that can be downloaded for specific time ranges. These reports can be exported to a CSV file or a PDf file.

Three report options are available for selection.

- All services and products by month.

- Custom reports.

These functions are only available on the Project Amber web interface.
